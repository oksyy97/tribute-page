    <p class="text">Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5, and incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music videos. According to Sanjoy Roy of the Guardian, Jackson would "flick and retract his limbs like switchblades, or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand". The moonwalk, taught to him by Jeffrey Daniel, was Jackson's signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century. Jackson is credited for coining the name "moonwalk"; the move was previously known as the "backslide". His other moves included the robot,crotch grab, and the "anti-gravity" lean of the "Smooth Criminal" video.</p>
    <p class="text">What videos are my favorite? There are many. But if I had to name one video, it would be "In The Closet". Simply mesmerizing. Check it out:</p>
